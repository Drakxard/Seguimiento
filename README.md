## Seguimiento API

This project now exposes three **GET** endpoints to assist with study planning. All
requests require a unique `reqId` and timestamp `ts` query parameter and respond
with `Cache-Control: no-store`.

- `GET /api/next`: query params `slotMinutes`, `currentTrack?`, `forceSwitch?` and
  the required `reqId`, `ts`. It returns the next recommended track to study or
  `204` when there are no pending tracks.
- `GET /api/progress`: query params `track`, optional `minutes`, `nextIndex`, plus
  `reqId` and `ts`. It registers completed work on a track, returning the updated
  track and the next suggestion. Repeated `reqId` values are ignored.
- `GET /api/tracks`: returns a summary of all tracks including quota, deficit and
  days remaining.

Each suggestion includes the planned acts and minutes together with a reason and
diagnostic values (`Î”, D, R, cuota, score`) that follow the scheduling rules.
