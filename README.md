## Seguimiento API

This project now exposes two endpoints to assist with study planning:

- `POST /api/next`: receives `{ slotMinutes, currentTrackSlug?, forceSwitch? }` and
  returns the next recommended track to study. Responds with `204` when there are
  no pending tracks.
- `POST /api/progress`: receives `{ trackSlug, minutesSpent?, nextIndex? }` to
  register completed work on a track and returns the updated track along with the
  next suggestion.

Each suggestion includes the planned acts and minutes together with a reason and
diagnostic values (`Î”, D, R, cuota, score`) that follow the scheduling rules.
